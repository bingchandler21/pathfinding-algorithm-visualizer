# pathfinding-algorithm-visualizer



Welcome to the Graph Algorithm Visualizer project!

This project aims to provide a visual representation of various graph algorithms, allowing users to observe and analyze their behavior in real-time. The application provides an interactive interface where users can input their own graph structures and select from a range of algorithms to visualize.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch graph algorithms in action with a real-time visualization.
- **Custom Graph Input**: Create and modify graph structures to experiment with different scenarios.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Choose from a variety of graph algorithms, such as A-star, BFS, and more.
- **Customizable Options**: Adjust visualization speed, node colors, and other settings to suit your preferences.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface that makes it easy to interact with and understand.
